# 语法学习过程

词/词组 --> 简单句 --> 复合句

单词和词组只能靠自己平时积累

# 简单句

## 成分

1. 主语	Subject
2. 谓语    Verb
3. 宾语    Object

一个句子可以没有主语：

* Open your eyes.
* Stand up.
* Look at me.

一个句子可以没有宾语：

* I see.
* You know.

**一个句子必须有谓语：**

`What a nice day!`   这是一个词组/意群
(意群是指句子中按意思和结构划分出的各个成分，每一个成分即称为一个意群。同一意群中的词与词关系紧密，不能随意拆分，否则就会引起误解)

`What a nice day it is!`  这是一个句子

其他意群：

* No comments
* Go
* Come on
* ......

---

### 主语的范畴

* 名词
* 代词
* 动名词 doing
* 动词不定式 to do
* 名词性从句

---

#### 名词作主语

当名词作主语的时候要注意 可数/不可数名词

**可数名词**

`Apple is my favorite fruit.`  ×

**可数名词包装：**

* 特	the apple
* 一    an apple
* 泛    apples
* 限    my apple

**不可数名词**

`Water is necessary for most creatures on the earth.`  √

**不可数名词包装：**

* 特	the water
* 量    a glass of water
* 类    waters (表示水的种类，地下水、山泉水等等)
  其他类似的有 airs fishes
* a water
  口语中：Please give me a water   没问题
  但是在严格的语法规范下不可以这么使用

**The + adj.**

The+形容词 adj. 可成为 `类属名词` 
具体谓语动词要看所描述的事物是一个单数还是复数

* the rich
* the poor 
* the noisy

---

#### 代词作主语

**注意主语和宾语之间的变化**

```
You - you  你
I - me
He - him
She - her
It - it
They - they
You - you  你们
We - us
```

一个句子中不能滥用代词，否则别人会听不懂

eg. Could you call him and him ?

---

#### 动名词&不定式作主语

这两者的区别？

```
Jogging is my dayily activity.
当有人说这个句子的时候，潜台词是这个人已经有慢跑这个习惯

To become a millionaires is the dream of most people.
当有人说这句话的时候，潜台词是这个人还没成为百万富翁
```

**二者的区别：**

* Doing --- 发生过/经验/事实/主观上非常肯定的事
* Todo --- 未发生/预期/推测

eg.

```
Drinking more water will possibly help your recovery.	×
关键词：possibly   
说明说话的人不确定，因此要用 Todo
To drink more water will possibly help your recovery.	√


To drink more water will surely help your recovery.		×
关键词：surely
说明说话的人非常肯定，因此要用 Doing
虽然陈述的这件事未必是一个事实，但是这可能是说话人的一个经验，表非常肯定
Drinking more water will surely help your recovery.		√

My goal is being accepted by my dream university.		×
关键词：My goal	
都说了是目标，那么肯定不能用 Doing，因为这是未发生的事情
My goal is to be accepted by my dream university.		√

No one is reported getting injured in the accident.		×
关键词：No one
既然是没有人受伤，就不能用 Doing，因为这(有人受伤)不是事实
No one is reported to get injured in the accident.		√ 
```

#### 动名词和不定式拓展

* try to do		准备尝试去做，但还没做
* try doing       尝试做，已经开始了

```
译：我下周打算学习一套新的语法系统
I try to learn a new system of gramma next week.
解析：因为还没开始做，所以这里用 try to do

译：我现在在学习一套新的语法系统 (假设现在在上第一节课)
I am trying learning a new system of gramma.
```

#### 名词性从句作主语

详见复合句章

---

### 谓语

重点是**时态**和**单复数**

详见下一章

---

### 宾语

宾语的成分和主语的成分相似，使用规则也是一样的

* 名词
* 代词
* 动名词 doing
* 动词不定式 todo
* 名词性从句

---

## 修饰

### 基本概念

* 形容词修饰名词
* 副词修饰动词、形容词、句子

### 形容词

#### 特殊

doing 主动 / done 被动 / 名词 也可作为形容词

* the changing world                这个变化的世界
* the deceived consumer         被欺骗的消费者
* a 5-star hotel                         5星级酒店

#### 顺序

**唯一的规则：越重要越靠近**

```
I would like to talk with a smart, positive and ambitious person.
潜台词：我认为一个人最重要的品质是 ambitious，其次是 positive，最后是 smart

I would like to talk with a positive, ambitious and smart person.
潜台词：我认为一个人最重要的品质是 smart，其次是 ambitious，最后是 positive

有一些书上说的，红的大的圆的桌子xxx。。
这样的考题毫无意义，考官要你猜他认为最重要的是什么，这个是很扯淡的
```



### 副词

#### 特殊

时间 - 地点  常被当作 adv. 使用

```
Yesterday, I went to the opera.

On the roof, you can embrace the view of the city.
```

#### 位置

关于副词的位置，最好是前置，防止产生歧义

```
Luckily, we have passed all the tests. 



We have passed all the tests luckily.
这个句子可能会被听者翻译成两种可能性

1. Luckily, we have passed all the tests.
译：太幸运了，我们通过了所有的考试
潜台词：我们通过了所有的考试，其中可能取得了好成绩
或者 我们幸运地通过了好成绩 (低空飞过)

2. We have luckily passed all the tests.
译：我们幸运地通过了好成绩 (低空飞过)
```



### 用形容词还是副词？

判断标准是：看说话人具体想修饰什么

```
He steps on the rostrum, confidently.
两种解释
1.他非常自信地走向讲台  (修饰句子)
2.他走向讲台的步伐非常自信 (修饰 steps) 
第二种解释很明显是不合理的，因为自信是形容人的

He steps on the rostrum, confident.  √
这个句子的 confident 修饰的是他 (人)，明显符合语义
```

---

# 动词

**谓语动词表现形式：**

* do
* be (am-is-are-was-were)  本身没有意思
* can  do/be    可表示情绪和塑造氛围

## 时态

时态的**本质意义：**
展示**关联动作**发生的**先后顺序**

```
思考
Before I ___ to school, I had my breakfast.
After I ___ to school, I had my breakfast.
```

### 基本时间点

有6个时态为时间轴上的基本点，从过去到未来为

1. had done
2. did  过去的基本
3. have done
4. do  现在的基本
5. will do  将来的基本
6. will have done

```
Before I have gone to school, I had my breakfast.
两个动作：去学校、吃早餐
这两个动作在这句话中是有关联的；
而题目中我们已知吃早餐是个基本点，由句意可知吃早餐是发生在上学之前(上学是发生在吃早餐之后)；
同时，按照常理来说，说这句话的时候上学和吃早餐这两件事已经发生了，因此是在 do 以前；
由上述时间点可知  此处用 have gone；

After I had gone to school, I had my breakfast.
两个动作：去学校、吃早餐；
这两个动作在这句话中也是有关联的；
而这句话是说我先到的学校，然后再吃早餐；
按照事件发生顺序可知这里用 had gone；
```

More practice

```
1.昨天我发现我掌握了8000核心单词
Yesterday, I realized that I had mastered 8000 core vocabulary.
动作：意识、掌握
按道理来说肯定是先掌握再意识

2.现在，我发现自己犯了一个错
Now, I find that I have made a mistake.

Now, I find that I made a mistake.
这种翻译在语法上没错，但是没有第一个好；
原因是这样翻译体现不出两个动作的关联性；

3.我明天去上海，并在后天到达伦敦
I will go to Shanghai tomorrow and will have arrived at London the day after tomorrow.
```

---

### 基本时间点的选择

```
before now —— have done
right now —— do
after now —— will do
since now —— will do

before 1990 —— had done
in 1990 —— did
after 1990 —— have done
since 1990 —— have done

before tomorrow —— do
on tomorrow —— will do
after tomorrow —— will have done
since tomorrow —— will have done
```

**注意：**
**只有动作有关联性才有讨论顺序的必要**

```
By 1990, scientists had discovered that sleeping quality has huge impact on acquired personalities.

两个动词：发现、对xxx有巨大影响
这两个动作是没有关联的，因此该怎么用就怎么用
“发现”这个动作前面有个时间状语作了一个限制
而后面的“睡眠质量对人的性格有深刻影响”是一个客观事实
```

---

### be doing

使动作拉长 (非瞬时动作)

```
When I was listening to the music, I suddenly saw the dog.
两个动作：听音乐、看到狗
两个动作没有强调先后顺序的必要，因此都用的 did
而听音乐这个动作是个非瞬时动作，因此用 be doing

I had been learning drawing before I entered the university.
两个动作：学画画、上大学
这两个动作有关联性，强调先学的画画再上的大学
因此学画画用 had done，上大学用 did
而学画画不是一瞬间能学会的，因此要用 be doing
```

**完善时间轴**

1. had done
   * had been doing
2. did
   * was / were doing
3. have done
   * have / has been doing
4. do
   * am / is / are doing
5. will do
   * will be doing
6. will have done
   * will have been doing

---

### 被动 be done

```
He is cheating me.
I am cheated.

He ate the apple.
The apple was eaten by him.
```

**被动语态的基本时间点**

1. had done —— had been done
2. did —— was / were done
3. have done —— have / has been done
4. do —— am / is / are done
5. will do —— will be done
6. will have done —— will have been done

---

### 延长被动

先 be doing，再 be done 

```
The old woman has been being cheated buying health products for more than 5 years.

长时间 more than 5 years  
延长被动 has been being cheated
这里用buying 不用 to buy 的原因是这个行为确实已经发生了
```

---

### 总结

```
基本时间点
	had done
	did
	have done
	do
	will do
	will have done
	
延长动作
	had been doing
	was/were doing
	have/has been doing
	am/is/are doing
	will be doing
	will have been doing
	
被动
	had been done
	was/were done
	have/has been done
	am/is/are done
	will be done
	will have been done
	
长被动
	had been being done
	was/were being done
	have/has been being done
	am/is/are being done
	will be being done
	will have been being done

译：在我参加这次面试前，我在A公司工作了10年
Before I took this interview, I had been working for A company for 10 years.  (聊起过去的事)

Before I take this interview, I have been working for A company for 10 years.  (聊现在发生的事)


译：该产品明年投入市场，并从后年起持续在电视上做广告
The product will be launched in the market next year and will have been being advertised on TV since the year after the next.

## 情态动词

按**程度**区分

* can do   能
* must do   shall do    should do    必须
* will do     would do     乐意
* may do    might do    打算

---

## 单复数

1. 根据主语来选择

   ```
   You see.
   I see.
   He sees.
   They see.
   ```

   ```
   A group of students is doing sports.
   关键词： a group
   
   Part(s) of students are surfing on the smart phone.
   注意：在这里，Part和Parts是一样的
   可数名词的部分或者多个部分，谓语动词用复数形式
   
   Part(s) of the water is polluted.
   不可数名词的部分，谓语动词用单数形式
   
   Part(s) of the building is destroyed.
   ```

   ```
   The number of species has been declining.
   物种的数量(一个数字)  
   
   A number of species have disappeared during the past 10 years.
   解析：a number of 表很多，与 many 同义
   ```

2. 就近原则 

   使用就近原则的特征是句子有 or nor 等逻辑词
   根据离谓语动词最近的主语来选择单复数

   ```
   Neither fruits nor juice is necessary.
   juice
   
   Either juice of fruits are acceptable.
   fruits
   
   Juice or fruits make no difference.
   fruits
   
   There is juice or fruits available.
   juice
   ```

   ```
   Finishing one presentation and 2 tests in the previous week has drained me off.
   这里用 has 的原因是尽管完成的事情有两件，但是只有一个动作 Finishing
   不管做多少事，都是包含在 Finishing 这个动作中的
   
   Finishing one presentation and passing 2 tests have drained me off.
   这里有 Finishing 和 passing 两个动作，因此谓语动词用复数形式
   
   就近原则：
   Finishing one presentation or passing 2 tests makes no difference.
   逻辑词 or   离谓语动词最近的只有一个动作 passing
   因此谓语动词用单数
   ```

3. 区别主语是一组还是多个

   ```
   The question and answer is all but neccessary.
   解析：the question and answer  这是搭配的一组Q&A
   
   The question and the answer tell us more about discrepancy.
   解析：the question and the answer 这是两个东西了
   
   Her beauty, sincerity and integrity makes her the signal of woman in virtue.
   解析：她的美丽、真诚和正直 都是属于她(Her)的
   因此当做是一组
   ```

4. 特殊

   ```
   Lily and Lucy form a group.
   
   Lily and Lucy forms a group.
   
   上述两者都是正确的，两种理解都说得通
   ```

---

# 复合句

**基本原则：**
一个句点( . ? ! )前，在主句中有且只有一个动词，其他参与表达的动词必须被“罩住”

## 并列句

```
I love apples he loves bananas.  ×
一个句点前有两个动词
```

**并列句的罩子**

* and
* but 
* or 
* so
* ;
* <u>then</u>
* <u>yet</u>

```
I love apples, he loves bananas.  ×
逗号没有“罩子”功能，其只表示语义的停顿

I love apples; he loves bananas.  √

I love apples but, he loves bananas.	√
逗号只是表达你想停顿的地方
让读者体会到你写作时的呼吸

I love apples, and he loves bananas.  √

I love apples, however, he loves bananas.	×
however 是一个副词，不是“罩子”

I love apples; but he loves bananas.	×
两个“罩子”

I love apples, so he loves bananas.	√
这个句子看起来是逻辑不通
然而世界上没有不通的逻辑，只有想不到的背景

I love apples, then he loves bananas.	√

I love apples; yet he loves bananas.	√
最后两个带下划线的“罩子”
如果句子中已经有一个“罩子”，其充当副词
如果句子中没有”罩子“，则其充当”罩子“
```

**注意：**

however / therefore / hence / thus  只能修饰不能罩

```
I love apples and bananas.  √
这里的 and 是一个普通的连词而不是“罩子”
因为“罩子”是为了使一个句子中的其他动词符合语法
```

---

## 名词性从句

名词性从句也有“罩子”，其作用是将一个**完整句子**包装起来，使其如名词般被使用

eg.

```
He makes me happy.
他这个人，让我开心

That he has told me lots of jokes makes me happy.
That (he has told me lots of jokes)
他将很多笑话这件事 让我开心
```

```
天气变化无常，这使得很多人生病了。
译：That the weather changes quickly makes many people sick.
名词性从句作主语

你必须懂得成功是建立在持久努力之上的。
译：You have to know that success is based on persistent trying.
名词性从句作宾语

除了还会和父母要钱，他基本已经和家里断绝联系了。
译：Except that he still asks for money from his parents, he barely has any contact with his family.
名词性从句作状语

综上可看到，名词性从句的 that 带领一个完整句子，而整个名词性从句充当一个句子成分
```

**what 引导的名词性从句**

```
我喜欢吃起来甜的东西
解析：
主语——我  谓语——喜欢  宾语——吃起来甜的东西;

吃起来甜 —— taste sweet，然而这个句子不完整，缺个主语;

XX tastes sweet  句子完整了;

I fancy that XX tastes sweet. 语法上成立了，但是没人会这么用;

当名词罩 that 中有一个补充成分 XX 存在时，可以把 that 和 XX合并成 what;

I fancy what tastes sweet.	√



再来一个练习：
盒子里装着看起来像牛奶的东西。
解析：XX looks like milk
译：The box contains what looks like milk.

你需要知道的是成功是建立在长久努力之上的。
解析：That XX you need to know
译：What you need to know is that success is based on persistent trying.

让你快乐的东西也让我快乐。
解析：XX makes you happy
译：What makes you happy makes me happy too.

除了让你开心的东西，我什么都给不了你。
译：Except what makes you happy, I can offer you nothing.
```

**what 进阶使用**

what 后面可以跟名词使指示更加清晰；

也可以加 -ever 起强调作用

```
1.
一般：
I know what I need to tell you.
进阶：
I know what story I need to tell you.
备注：这里的 story 不一定是指童话故事的那种 story，在生活中更多的是指某件事的来龙去脉

2.
一般：
I know what movie I should watch.
进阶：
I know whatever movie I should watch. 
(我很清楚要看什么电影，不用你来教)
备注：I konw which movie I should watch.
口语可以这么说，但是书面语不推荐这么写
```

**引导词升级**

that 本身没有任何意思，如果要加入意思可用以下词替换

* when 
* where
* why
* whether
* how ( much / often / soon ... )

```
I konw that you have stolen my money.

I konw when you have stolen my money.

I konw where you have stolen my money.

I konw why you have stolen my money.

I konw how you have stolen my money.

I konw how much you have stolen my money.
```

**that 省略的问题**

罩**动宾**的 that 可以省略，但是罩**介宾**和**主语**的就不可以

但是书面语上尽量不要省略，完整写出来会显得更正式

```
You have to know that success is based on persistent trying.
这里的名词性从句充当主句中谓语后面的宾语成分，可以省略that
You have to know success is based on persistent trying.

That the weather changes quickly makes many people sick.
这里的名词性从句充当主句中的主语成分，因此不能省略 that

Except that he still asks for money from his parents, he barely has any contact with his family.
这里的名词性从句在主句中充当状语，充当介词后面的宾语成分
因此不能省略 that
```

**掌握了名词性从句后，可以用一个完整的句子来代替一个词，这样写出来的文章会更加温和，更容易拉近与读者的距离**

---

## 状语从句

副词的拓展，状语从句的本质是使一个完整的句子有一个副词的功能

eg.

```
一般副词:
Generally, greedy people will hardly be satisfied with anything.
状语从句:
As we know, greedy people will hardly be satisfied with anything.

一般副词:
In 1949, Chinese people began to accept new social values.
状语从句:
When the PRC was established, Chinese people began to accept new social values.
```

**常用状语从句引导词**

* 时间
  * while
  * when
  * as
  * since
  * before
  * after
  * until
* 地点
  * where
* 因果
  * because
  * since
  * for
  * as
* 让步 / 尽管
  * although
  * though
  * even though
* 条件
  * if
  * only if
  * even if
  * unless

**使用正解**

```
一个句子不能没有主句
Although he is old, but he still loves sports. ×
Alouth 是个副词罩
but 是个并列罩

Although he is old, he still loves sports, but he just cannot run as fast as he was young.  √
although 是个副词罩 包装 he is old
but 是个并列罩 包装 he just cannot run
as 比较的罩子 包装 he was young
```

```
If you cannot find and direction when you graduate from the college, it is wise for you to continue graduate education since such advanced study will possibly help you know better about yourself even if others may regard such study futile.

解析：
If  包装 cannot find
when 包装 graduate from the college
主句：it is wise for you to continue graduate education
since 包装 will possibly help you know better about yourself
even if 包装 others may regard such study futile

大意：如果你大学毕业后迷失方向你应该选择读研，因为读研可以让你更好地了解你自己，尽管别人可能会认为读研是一件无意义的事情
```

**状语从句使用位置**

```
翻译以下句子
I will give you the message that the meeting can be held on time if the weather is fine.
翻译：
1.如果天气好我会短信通知你会议会如期举行
2.我会短信通知你如果天气好，会议会如期举行

第二种翻译是无论如何都会发信息
因此，这个句子在语法上虽然没问题，但是信息接收者的想法可能会和你想的不同
```

**建议：**

和副词使用一样，状语从句最好放在修饰句前面，尽量避免歧义

---

### 状语从句进阶

* 保持主句和从句的主语一致，突出关联性

  ```
  1.When he is playing the piano, his mother feels proud of him.
  
  2.When he is playing the piano, he makes his mother feels proud of him.
  
  第一个句子的主句和从句关联不大，听众可能会觉得两个句子没有关联；
  而第二个句子可以强调二者的关联性；
  
  1. When I open the door, a dog ran out.
  2. When I open the door, I saw a dog ran out.
  ```

  ```
  1.如果你被派到美国工作，公司会给你提供英文培训
  If you are assigned to work in US, you will be offered English language training by the company.
  
  2.当你迫不及待地做一件事情时，这件事往往会失去控制
  When you are anxious to do something, you will lose control of it.
  ```

* 主从的主语一致同时从句有 be 动词可省略从句中的主语和 be 动词

  ```
  1.主动
  When he is playing the piano, he makes his mother feels proud of him.
  改：When playing the piano, he makes his mother feels proud of him.
  
  2.被动
  If you are assigned to work in US, you will be offered English language training by the company.
  改：If assigned to work in US, you will be offered English language training by the company.
  
  3.be动词之后，接形容词词组或介词词组
  When you are anxious to do something, you will lose control of it.
  改：When anxious to do something, you will lose control of it.
  ```

* 激发读者思考的句子

  ```
  在第二种情况(从句的主语和be被省略)下，从句已经不是一个完整的句子了，这个时候从句的引导词所起到的保证句子语法通畅的作用已经形同虚设了；
  而从句的引导词直接指出了主从句的关系，比如说因果、条件判断等等，这时既然引导词已经没有起到维持语法的作用了，那我们可以省略该引导词，让读者去思考主从之间是什么关系；
  ```

  eg.

  ```

**美句赏析**

```
I should wish to die while still at work, knowing that others will carry on what I can no longer do, and content in the thought that what was possible has been done.

我希望在工作中死去，(因为我)知道其他人会继续做我未竟的事业，(并且为)所完成的事而感到满足。

完整句子：
I should wish to die while (I am) still at work, (because I am) knowing that others will carry on what I can no longer do, and (because I am) content in the thought that what was possible has been done.

其中的名词性从句：
what I can no longer do
in the thought that what was possible has been done

时态方面，清晰而连贯
I should wish to die   虚拟 详见后文;
others will carry on  将会继续  立足现在 用一般将来时;
what was possible has been done  先有可能(did)，再做完(has been done)，到现在我就可以 (wish to die);
```

## 定语从句

定语从句本质是使一个句子作为一个形容词来修饰名词

eg.

```
I see many homeless pet dogs.
I see many pet dogs which are abandoned by their hosts. 
```

```
1.1 Tom is a teacher.
1.2 Tom teaches in the Cambridge.
解析：
两个句子有相同的名词 Tom;
只要将第二个句子的Tom换成who再合并即可;
Tom is a teacher who teaches in the Cambridge.

2.1 I will go to London.
2.2 My mother lives in London.
解析：
两个句子有相同的名词 London;
把第二个句子的London换成which，同时与其介词in移动到句首进行合并;
I will go to London in which my mother lives.

3.1 I have a dog.
3.2 The dog's name is YY.
解析：
两个句子有相同的名词 dog;
第二个句子的名词带's，所以将其用whose替换
I have a dog whose name is YY.
```

**总结：**

1. 两个句子有相同名词

2. 找出重点句，重点句作为主句不变

3. 非重点句的相同名词变成定语从句罩子

   1. 人 —— who / whom
   2. 物 —— which
   3. N's —— whose

   **注意：**不是所有的名词都适用于用 N's；
   比如说教室的光：the classroom's light  虽然也可以这么说，但是不严谨;
   应该说成 the light of the classroom;
   比如说树的年龄：the tree's age  没问题

4. 如果罩子不在句首，则要移前；若罩子前面有介词或词组，**最好**一起移动(保证意群完整，像上述第二个例句)

**练习：**

```
1.1 Bats locate flying insects. 
1.2 They feed on flying insects.
解析：
第一句话是重点;
相同名词使flying insects;
第二个句子名词变which，同时与其介词一起移前合并;
Bats locate flying insects on which they feed.

2.1 We need to turn to echo-location to see a case.
2.2 Voice plays an utilitarian role in the case.
解析：
第一句话是重点;
相同名词是which;
第二个句子名词变which，同时与其介词一起移前合并;
We need to turn to echo-location to see a case in which voice plays an utilitarian role.

3.1 The echo-location in bats is often compared with radar.
3.2 The principle of radar is similar.
解析：
两种情况，两个句子都可以作为重点句;
相同名词是radar;
假如将第一个句子作为重点:
第二个句子名词变which，而其中的 The principle of radar 是一个词组，不用拆，所以总体已经是在句子开头，合并时不用移动位置;
The echo-location in bats is often compared with radar the principle of which is similar.

假如将第二个句子作为重点：
第一个句子的名词变which，合并时与其介词一起放句首;
The principle of radar, with which the echo-location in bats is often compared, is similar.
逗号的使用是为了让句子更加清晰;
```

**判断以下句子是否合理**

```
1.Yesterday, I bought a book, half of which it is possible for me to understand.
解析：
将该句子拆解可得
1.1 Yesterday, I bought a book. (主句)
1.2 It is possible for me to understand half of the book. (移前的介宾还原)

2.Yesterday, I bought a book, half of which is possible for me to understand.
解析：
将该句子拆解可得
2.1 Yesterday, I bought a book. (主句)
2.2 Half of the book is possible for me to understand.
第二句的book只能作为主语;
这时语法上虽然没问题，但是逻辑是不通的;
不能说书的一半是有可能的，只能说理解书的一半是有可能的;
```

### 定语从句进阶

定语从句**罩子**使用**规则**：

* 人 ——  who (宾语whom)
  who既可以是主语也可以是宾语，但是精确使用的话会更高级

* 物 —— which

* 非人非物 (想法、概念等等) / 可人可物 —— that

  **只能**用 that 的情况

  1. something
  2. anything
  3. nobody
  4. all
  5. one of
  6. best + n.

  ```
  eg.
  最美丽的女人 -> 不是女人 -> 是女神 用that
  最聪明的狐狸 -> 不是狐狸 -> 是狐狸精 用that
  
  以上只是辅助记忆的一个技巧而已。。(*^▽^*)
  译：这是我吃过的最好吃的蛋糕
  This is the best cake that I have ever tasted.
  ```

* 介词之后**只能**出现 which / whom，其他不可取

  ```
  Tom is the best candidate that I am looking for.
  这里用 that 是因为替代的是 the best candidate 没问题
  
  但是如果把介词一起提前，则这里只能用 whom，不能用 that
  Tom is the best candidate for whom I am looking. (高级)
  ```

* 介词与w合并
  when = 介词 + 表时间的 which
  where = 介词 + 表地点的 which

  ```
  1.1 I will go to London in which my mother lives.
  1.2 I will go to London where my mother lives.
  
  2.1 I will arrange the party tomorrow on which Tom can ask for leave.
  2.2 I will arrange the party tomorrow when Tom can ask for leave.
  
  书面语的高级版就是大众不常说的
  ```

* 单独替换宾语的罩子可以省略

  ```
  1.
  This is the best cake that I have ever tasted.
  解析：在这个句子中 that 指代的是 the best cake
  同时由于前面没有介词，因此可以将这个 that 省略
  This is the best cake I have ever tasted.
  
  2.
  The problem that you must pay attention to will exert huge impact in the future.
  解析：
  定语从句还原之后是:
  You must pay attention to the problem.
  合并之后的定语从句只将替代的名词置前，因此前面没有介词，可以省略;
  The problem you must pay attention to will exert huge impact in the future.
  当然，高级版是将介词也一并提前:
  The problem to which you must pay attention will exert huge impact in the future.
  ```

* W / that + be 可以整体省略，显得更加清爽简洁

  ```
  1.1 I see many pet dogs that are abandoned by their hosts.
  1.2 I see many pet dogs abandoned by their hosts.
  
  2.1 Those birds that were flying across the city must be migrating.
  2.2 Those birds flying across the city must be migrating.
  
  3.1 The person who is eager to see you has been waiting for 2 hours
  3.2 The person eager to see you has been waiting for 2 hours.
  ```

* 非限定性定语从句？？
  所谓的非限定性定语从句，其实是有歧义的，生活和书面语中不要使用

  ```
  Josh was admitted by the Cambridge which made him so satisfied.
  这个句子，我们并不能知道是Josh被剑桥录取这件事让他开心还是剑桥这所学校让他开心。。我们不能奢望我们说出有歧义的句子的时候，听者想的和我们想的一样;
  消除歧义：
  1. 直接去掉逗号
  Josh was admitted by the Cambridge which made him so satisfied.
  如果表达的是学校让 Josh 开心，这样写没问题;
  但是逗号是作者写作时的呼吸，直接把逗号去掉会影响情绪的渲染;
  2. 把被修饰的点换一个词放到罩子前 (高级无敌版)
  Josh was admitted by the Cambridge, the school which made him so satisfied.	(学校让Josh开心、满意)
  Josh was admitted by the Cambridge, the acceptance that made him so satisfied. (录取这件事让Josh满意)
  
  
  eg.
  He has tried whatever means possible to make the project better, the hard-work which is hugely acclaimed by the boss. 
  将这个高级的句子再精简一下 (W + be 可以省略)
  He has tried whatever means possible to make the project better, the hard-work hugely acclaimed by the boss.
  ```

**注意：以上规则可以叠加使用**

---

# 虚拟语气

## 小虚拟

用来表达假设、祝愿、建议

**结构:**

```
xxx V(假设、祝愿、建议) that ... (should) be/do ...
这个 `should` 最好不要写出来，不然会显得很 LOW
```

```
I wish that you be 18 forever.

I suggest that LSE be your first choice. 

I used to recommend that Tom join our group.
```



## 大虚拟

用来假设真实

eg. 如果我是你，我会xxx

* 如果是对**现在**做假设
  if 从句中实意动词用 did、be 动词用 were
  实意动词都用 did，主句中用 would do
* 如果是对**过去**做假设
  if 条件所有的事态用 had done
  主句用 would have done
* 如果是对**将来**做假设
  if条件中用 were to
  主句用 would do

**注意：主句和从句的时态可能是不一样的，一定要实事求是**

```
1.如果我是你，我就去美国念书
If I were you, I would go to study in US.

2.如果Tom有现金，他肯定会借给你
If Tom had cash, he would certainly lend it to you.

3.如果我过去多做练习，现在就不会紧张了
注意：这里是对过去做假设，现在的结果
If I had done more practice (in the past), I would not be nervous (now)

4.如果我没有出这个错，我早就通过考试了
If I had not made this mistake, I would have passed the exam.
```



## 虚拟倒装

这种语法目的是为了突出主句，引导听众将注意力放在主句上

为了突出主句，高级语法会将 if 去掉

**规则：**

* 将动词提前，if 去掉
* 注意区分语法词和实意动词
  * 如果有语法词，则只要将语法词提前
  * 如果没有语法词，将 if 去掉换成虚拟助动词

```
1.1 If I were you, I would go to study in America.
1.2 Were I you, I would go to study in America.

2.1 If Tom had cash, he would certainly lend it to you.
2.2 Should Tom have cash, he would certainly lend it to you.
语法词：null  实意动词 had

3.1 If I had done more practice , I would not be nervous now.
3.2 Had I done more practice , I would not be nervous now.
语法词：had  实意动词：done

4.1 If I had not made this mistake, I would have passed the exam.
4.2 Had I not made this mistake, I would have passed the exam.
4.3 Had not I made this mistake, I would have passed the exam.
语法词：had  实意动词：made
```

**虚拟倒装进阶** (最~~装逼~~ 高级)

原理是将主句放在开头，将从句放在末尾从而更加强调主句

```
1. I would go to study in America were I you.

2. Tom would definitely lend it to you should he have cash.
注意与上述相应例句比较，代词 he 应该要后置

3. I would not be nervous now had I done more practice.

4. I would have passed the exam had I not made this mistake.
```

---

# there be

表示存在性的有，而不是表从属

eg. 
我有一辆车 (车属于我);

那边有辆车 (车不属于我);

**正确使用：**

当听众和你没有一个基本默契，或者说基本概念的时候，直接说那里有个人、那里有xxx相当于说了一句废话，因为指代不明，因此在这种情况下要加上一点限制

```
废话：There is a bird.
↓
有意义的话：There is a bird on the roof.
```

**更加生动地表达：**

将 be 动词换成一个恰当的动词

```
There twitters a bird on the roof.
```

**将无实意的 there 替换掉：**

```
On the roof twitters a bird.
```

**再练习一遍**

```
There is a dream.
↓
There is a dream in my heart.
↓
There seeds a dream in my heart.
↓
In my heart seeds a dream.
```

---

# 比较级

## 词与词比较

比较的对象一定要注意有可比性

eg.

```
Unlike Mozart, Beethoven's music is full of personal fantasy.  ×
莫扎特 和 贝多芬的音乐   一个人一个物没有可比性;

1. Unlike that of Mozart, Beethoven's music is full of personal fantasy.
2. Unlike Mozart's (music), Beethoven's music is full of personal fantasy.

第二个句子要比第一个句子更胜一筹，因为不但比较内容一致，句子结构也一致
```

**引出比较的词**

* like
* unlike
* compare
* contrast
* in addition
* besides
* such as



## 句与句比较

* as ... as  	和...相当
* more than   比...更

**结构解析：**

`as ... as` 的第一个 as 和 `more than` 的 more 是一个副词，后面接 adv. / V / 句子;
`as ... as` 的第二个 as 和 `more than` 的 than 是一个语法词(罩子)，后面接句子;

**比较原则：比较的句子的结构需要平衡**

eg.

```
Tom 比 Jack 高。
比较句1：Tom is tall.
比较句2：Jack is tall.
合并：Tom is taller than Jack is tall.
这个合并句是最基础、最完整的句子，平常我们使用的都是这种句子处理后的
```

```
1.今年的GDP比去年增长了7%
The GDP of this year increases.
The GDP of last year increased.
1.1 The GDP of this year increases as 7% as the GDP of last year increased.
1.2 The GDP of this year is 7% more than the GDP of last year was.

2.年轻人接受新事物要比老年人接受新事物要快
The young accepts new things.
The old accepts new things.
2.1 The young accepts new things faster than the old accept new things.

3.当代美国人和上一代美国人一样接受新事物快
Americans of this generation accept new things.
Americans of last generation accepted new things.
3.1 Americans of this generation accept new things as fast as Americans of last generation accepted new things.

4.中国文化在日本文化传播比欧洲文化在美国传播要早
Chinese culture spread in Japan.
European culture spread in America.
4.1 Chinese culture spread in Japan earlier than European culture spread in America.
```



## 比较级进阶

### 变化的规则

* 比较的两个句子成分、内容一致时可以省略相同内容

  ```
  Tom is taller than Jack is tall.
  ↓
  Tom is taller than Jack is.
  ↓
  Tom is taller than Jack.
  ```

  ```
  思考：
  Tom is taller than Jack grows.  ×
  前句用的是be动词结构，后面用的是实意动词，句子不平衡
  ```

* 复合意群不可以省略

  ```
  Tom is taller than Jack is handsome.  √
  作者认为Tom的高比Jack的帅更胜一筹
  作者相对于Jack的帅更喜欢Tom的高
  这个句子不可省略，因为句子不平衡，不属于同一个系统
  
  eg.
  校园里的生活是舒服的
  Life in campus is comfortable.
  公司里的生活是有挑战性的
  Life in company is challenging.
  当我主观上认为舒服比挑战性更重要时，我可以说：
  Life in campus is more comfortable than life in company is challenging.
  译：(我觉得)校园里舒适的生活要比公司里富有挑战性的生活要好。
  ```

* 两个比较的句子都是be动词结构，在第二个句子中可省略be动词

  ```
  The GDP of this year is 7% more than the GDP of last year was.
  解析：
  两个比较的句子都有be动词，而且结构一致、比较的对象一致;
  这时第二个句子的 be 动词可以省略;
  The GDP of this year is 7% more than the GDP of last year.
  ```

* 中心词**部分**替换

  ```
  当两个比较句子的中心词相同时，可将第二个句子的中心词换成 that / those
  单数用 that，复数用 those
  
  原：The GDP of this year is 7% more than the GDP of last year.
  改：The GDP of this year is 7% more than that of last year.
  ```

* 两个比较句子的名词**全部**相同时，全部替换
  单数的主宾都用 it，复数的主语用 they，宾语用 them

  ```
  Young people accept new things faster than old people accept new things.
  解析：
  两个句子都有相同的 new things，而且没有任何附加的不同的修饰;
  Young people accept new things faster than old people accept them.
  ```

  **注意全部替换和部分替换使用场景的区别**

* **主语**全部相同时，除了替换还可以省略
  **注意：上述两条规则是针对名词，名词可以作主语也可以作宾语**

  ```
  Young people accept new things faster than young people abandon old things.
  解析：两个句子的主语都相同 (young people);
  因此这里既可以替换主语为 they，也可以将其省略
  Young people accept new things faster than (they) abandon old things.
  ```

* 动词替换
  **原则：动宾不分家 —— 如果动词后面接宾语，则要将其看成一个整体**
  替换要根据其时态和单复数进行：

  * had done
  * did
  * have / has done
  * do / does
  * will do
  * will have done

  ```
  Young people accept new things faster than old people accept new things.
  解析：
  第一句的动宾 accept new things  第二句的动宾 accept new things;
  Young people accept new things faster than old people do.
  ```

* 动宾极致同
  该规则是上一个规则的延伸
  如果两个句子的**动宾同**、**时态同**、**单复数同**的时候，可以省略

  ```
  Young people accept new things faster than old people accept new things.
  解析：
  两个句子，
  动宾同 accept new things
  时态同 一般现在时
  单复数同 同复数;
  Young people accept new things faster than old people
  ```

**备注：比较级的规则有点小多，但是理解了变化的原理之后就会舒服多了，建议从主语、谓语、宾语三个方面去区分记忆**

练习：

```
1.
Americans of this generation accept new things as fast as Americans of last generation accepted new things.

Americans of this generation accept new things as fast as those of last generation did.

2.
Chinese culture spread in Japan earlier than European culture spread in America.

Chinese culture spread in Japan earlier than European culture did in America.
再观察一下，两个句子还是动宾极致同
Chinese culture spread in Japan earlier than European culture in America.
```

**雷区**

had / has / have / have had
这几个词除非是作为实意动词，否则是错的

```
1.
I have 2 more apples than he has.
这里的 have 和 has 都是实意动词，没问题;
这里还可以做一个动词替换：
I have 2 more apples than he does.


2. 注意
Chinese culture spread in Japan earlier then European culture had in America.
动宾替换中没有 had，如果要将 had 当成语法词，那么要写成 had done 才是符合语法规则的，因此这句话是错的;
那换成 had done 行不行呢？
Chinese culture spread in Japan earlier than European culture had done in America.
这句话语法上没错，但是逻辑上自相矛盾;
字面意思是说中国文化在日本传播要比欧洲文化在美国传播要早，但是时态上却说是欧洲文化先传播的(详见时态章)，因此这句话也是错的;

Chinese culture spread in Japan earlier than European culture has done in America.
这句话没问题，但要注意和使用did的区别
did 是单纯比较两个事实 (莫得感情)
has done 更加强调这个先后顺序，突出关联性 (大大的感情)
```

### 富有感情的比较句

```
The weather is hotter than I have ever experience.
这个天气比我经历过的还要热

The price is much lower than I have expected.
这个价格比我预想的还要低

You are as tall as I have been told.
你和我被告知的那样高

This note is much more useful than I have imagined.
这份笔记比我想象的更有用  o(*￣︶￣*)o
```
